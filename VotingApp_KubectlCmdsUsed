Also two new observations regarding services:


[root@ip-172-31-10-212 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get svc
NAME     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db       ClusterIP   10.97.116.155   <none>        5432/TCP         3h12m
redis    ClusterIP   10.97.145.193   <none>        6379/TCP         3h12m
result   NodePort    10.101.94.177   <none>        5001:31007/TCP   3h12m
vote     NodePort    10.102.49.48    <none>        5000:31006/TCP   3h12m


First, only result and vote app has nodeport where as others have cluster IP. Reason being only these two app has requirement of external access whereas other two apps need access within cluster.


Second, worker app doesn't have service layer configured around it. Other 4 layers have service layer configured around it. A pod needs service layer if some entity outside pod wants to access this service. Vote and result app needs service layer because of need of external access. Redis app needs service layer as worker app wants to access it's information and push it to DB app. DB app needs service layer as result app wants to access it's information. Since no app needs info from worker app, hence worker app doesn't need service configured arund it.
